Web application built with Python Flask, JS, SQL &amp; Bootstrap 5.

## Macha Library

Macha Library is a web application for contributing, browsing and learning from Computer Science and Programming related
online resources. The app was created for members of the Macha Discord server, and includes a user registration & login 
feature for existing members.

It runs on desktop and mobile, & features a carousel data slide to display the available resources. To view Macha Library 
resources, or to contribute, login is required. Users then have the ability to add or delete resources. 

Resources, applicable categories for that resource, and associated data are also stored in a **SQLite3** database. Uploaded 
image files are stored as **blob** data within the database and are not uploaded to the server's file directory.

Application features include:

- User registration
- User sessions
- user login/logout
- SQL database
- Resource contribution form
- Image upload facility
- Resource deletion 
- Text search
- Category search

## Installation

Use the Python package manager to install Flask. You will also need **python3**.

```bash
pip install flask
```

Clone this repository, **cd** into the local directory and run the application on your **localhost** by doing the following:

- cd macha-library
- install flask

You may find it beneficial to run Macha Library in a **venv** environment.
